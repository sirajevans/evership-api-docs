# Shipments

Shipments are the core records in Evership â€” they represent the packages being prepared for delivery, including the sender and recipient information, parcel dimensions, and selected shipping service. On this page, we'll explore the endpoints available for managing shipments programmatically. You can create, retrieve, update, purchase, cancel, and delete shipments through the API.
## The shipment model

The shipment model stores all the details needed to fulfill and track a shipment. Each shipment must have a collection and delivery address, at least one parcel, and can optionally include metadata like order number or customer contact information. Shipments can be created in a pending state or immediately purchased if a rate is available.

    The "Create shipment" API will allow you to create a single shipment record on your account in either a pending or purchased state with a single call.  If the shipment is not purchased when the record is created you can purchase the shipment later using the [Purchase shipments](https://www.notion.so/Purchase-shipments-1d0f4d58d4e381cdb0a1f361936864af?pvs=21) API

## Edit Shipment {{ tag: 'PUT', label: 'https://api.evership.app/v1/shipments/{shipment_id}' }}

<Row>
  <Col>

    Use this endpoint to update an existing shipment that is still in a pending state.

    You can update the collection address, delivery address, parcel dimensions/quantities, and metadata fields. This is useful if your customer updated their delivery information or you need to fix a mistake before purchasing the shipment.

    Once a shipment is purchased via /purchase-shipment, it can no longer be updated and will return a 409 Conflict error.

## Retrieve Shipments {{ tag: 'GET', label: 'https://api.evership.app/shipments/{shipment_id}' }}

<Row>
  <Col>

    This API is different from [List shipments](https://www.notion.so/List-shipments-1d0f4d58d4e38128911ecdf642ae6384?pvs=21) API, here you can only fetch the details of a single shipment and not multiple shipments in a list.
    
    Using this "Retrieve shipment" API you can retrieve a single shipment record by passing the shipment's `shipment_id` and the response will return full details of the shipment, including the tracking log and shipping labels.
    Both purchased and un-purchased shipments can be retrieved using this "Retrieve shipment" API

## Cancel Shipments {{ tag: 'POST', label: 'https://www.api.evership.co.za/v1/cancel-shipment/{shipment_id}' }}

<Row>
  <Col>

    This "Cancel shipment" API will allow you to cancel a single shipment that has been purchased but not collected by the carrier (status = `requested` or `approved`) by passing the `shipment_id` of the shipment you want to cancel.

    In the case that you try to cancel a shipment that has a status = `pending` then we will return an error message, because the shipment has not been purchased yet.
    In the case that you try to cancel a shipment record where the status of the shipment â‰  `requested` or `approved` then we will return an error message, because this means that the shipment has already been collected by the carrier.
