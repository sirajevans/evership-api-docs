## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}
To get started, ensure you have a verified Evership account. If you donâ€™t have one yet, [sign up here](https://evership.app/register). Once your account is verified, login and generate an API key via [settings > integrations](https://evership.app/settings?section=integrations). From there, you can integrate any of our APIs into your product. {{ className: 'lead' }}
