# Webhooks

In this guide, we’ll walk through how to register and consume webhooks to receive real-time updates from Evership. Webhooks allow your system to react automatically whenever the status of a shipment changes — no polling required. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Registering webhooks

To set up a webhook, you’ll need a publicly accessible URL that Evership can send `POST` requests to. You can configure your webhook endpoint from the Evership dashboard under Settings > Integrations.

Once configured, Evership will send a `JSON` payload to your endpoint whenever the status of any shipment on your account changes. This allows you to automate workflows, such as triggering customer notifications or syncing shipment statuses in your internal systems.

Now, whenever something interesting happens in your app, a webhook is fired off by Evership. In the next section, we'll look at how to consume webhooks.

## Consuming webhooks

When your system receives a webhook request from Evership, you can inspect the payload to determine what shipment event triggered it. The webhook body includes key information such as the shipment ID, the new status, and a timestamp.

```json {{ title: 'Example webhook payload' }}
{
  "shipment_id": "EVER447171049",
  "status": "delivered",
  "status_slug": "delivered",
  "status_code": 9,
  "timestamp": "2025-04-27T14:10:08+02:00",
  "location": "CPT",
  "comments": "Signature obtained – your parcel has been delivered and signed for."
  // ...
}
```

In the example above, the shipment with ID `shp_01HF5TC8X63C3MFX3D0WTTVRHN` was updated to the `delivered` status. You can use this data to update your internal system, trigger notifications, or track delivery performance.
