# Labels

Labels are a critical part of the shipping process — they contain the carrier, service, barcode, and address information required for successful delivery. Evership provides two endpoints for retrieving shipping labels: one for individual shipments, and one for batches.

On this page, we’ll explore how to retrieve shipping labels programmatically, either in single or batch format. Labels can be generated in multiple sizes, and downloaded as ready-to-print PDF files.


## Introduction

The label model defines the format, URL, and relationship to the shipment(s). Labels are only available once a shipment has been successfully purchased.

The Retrieve label (single) endpoint lets you download labels in multiple formats for a single shipment, while the Retrieve label (batch) endpoint returns a single PDF file containing labels for multiple shipments in one consistent format.

## Retrieve a label (single) {{ tag: 'GET', label: '/v1/labels/single' }}

<Row>
  <Col>
    Using the "Retrieve label (single)" API you can pass the shipment_id of a purchased shipment and define the label formats that you want to be returned.
    The response will contain a URL to the shipment labels in each of the formats requested.

    ### Optional attributes

    <Properties>
      <Property name="shipment_id" type="string" required>
        Unique identifier for the shipment for which the label is being requested.
      </Property>
      <Property name="label_formats" type="string" required>
        Comma-separated list of label formats to be retrieved.<br/>
        Possible formats include:
        <ul>
          <li><code>10_10</code> = 10 cm × 10 cm label</li>
          <li><code>10_15</code> = 10 cm × 15 cm label</li>
          <li><code>a4_page</code> = label printed on an A4 page, 2 labels per page</li>
        </ul>
      </Property>

## Retrieve a label (batch) {{ tag: 'GET', label: '/v1/labels/batch' }}

<Row>
  <Col>
    Using this “Retrieve label (batch)” API you can pass multiple `shipment_id's` of a batch of purchased shipments and define the single label format that you want to be returned. 

    The response will contain a URL to single PDF file that contains the shipment labels of all of the `shipment_id's` requested in the format requested.

    **This is different from the [Retrieve label (single)](/labels#retrieve-a-label-single) API in 2 ways:**

    1. You can pass multiple `shipment_id's` and we will return a single PDF file that contains all of the labels of the requested shipment records
    2. You can only request for a single label format, not all three label formats.

    ### Optional attributes

    ### Request Fields
