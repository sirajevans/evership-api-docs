# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Evership API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Evership API, you will need to generate an
  API key from your Evership dashboard via [Integrations](https://evership.app).
</Note>

## Making your first API request

Once your API key is ready, we'll test it by creating a draft shipment â€” this will confirm that your integration is working and allow you to test sending parcel and address data without purchasing a label, as the `purchase_label` field is set to `false`.
