# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the Evership API. In this guide, we'll walk through how authentication works. Evership uses API key authentication as the standard and only method for securing your API requests. Youâ€™ll include your API key in the request headers to verify your identity and gain access.

## API Key authentication

Evership APIs require API key authentication to authorize requests. You must include your API key in the request headers to access any of our API endpoints.

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with API key auth' }}
curl https://api.evership.app/v1/shipments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Where to get your API key  
1. Log into your Evership Dashboard  
2. Navigate to Settings > Integrations  
3. Click Generate API Key

Use this key in your Authorization headers as shown above.
If you're using a tool like Postman, include the API key as a Bearer Token in the Authorization tab.

<Note>
Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
