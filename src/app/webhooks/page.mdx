# Webhooks

In this guide, we’ll walk through how to register and consume webhooks to receive real-time updates from Evership. Webhooks allow your system to react automatically whenever the status of a shipment changes — no polling required. {{ className:"lead" }}

## Registering webhooks

To set up a webhook, you’ll need a publicly accessible URL that Evership can send `POST` requests to. You can configure your webhook endpoint from the Evership dashboard under Settings > Integrations.

Once configured, Evership will send a `JSON` payload to your endpoint whenever the status of any shipment on your account changes. This allows you to automate workflows, such as triggering customer notifications or syncing shipment statuses in your internal systems.

Now, whenever something interesting happens in your app, a webhook is fired off by Evership. In the next section, we'll look at how to consume webhooks.

## Consuming webhooks

When your system receives a webhook request from Evership, you can inspect the payload to determine what shipment event triggered it. The webhook body includes key information such as the shipment ID, the new status, and a timestamp.

```json {{ title: 'Example webhook payload' }}
{
  "shipment_id": "EVER447171049",
  "status": "delivered",
  "status_slug": "delivered",
  "status_code": 9,
  "timestamp": "2025-04-27T14:10:08+02:00",
  "location": "CPT",
  "comments": "Signature obtained – your parcel has been delivered and signed for."
  // ...
}
```

In the example above, the shipment with ID `shp_01HF5TC8X63C3MFX3D0WTTVRHN` was updated to the `delivered` status. You can use this data to update your internal system, trigger notifications, or track delivery performance.

## Security

To know for sure that a webhook was, in fact, sent by Protocol instead of a malicious actor, you can verify the request signature. Each webhook request contains a header named `x-protocol-signature`, and you can verify this signature by using your secret webhook key. The signature is an HMAC hash of the request payload hashed using your secret key. Here is an example of how to verify the signature in your app:

<CodeGroup title="Verifying a request">

```js
const signature = req.headers['x-protocol-signature']
const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(payload).digest('hex')

if (hash === signature) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}
```

```python
from flask import request
import hashlib
import hmac

signature = request.headers.get("x-protocol-signature")
hash = hmac.new(bytes(secret, "ascii"), bytes(payload, "ascii"), hashlib.sha256)

if hash.hexdigest() == signature:
    # Request is verified
else:
    # Request could not be verified
```

```php
$signature = $request['headers']['x-protocol-signature'];
$hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secret);

if (hash_equals($hash, $signature)) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}
```

</CodeGroup>

If your generated signature matches the `x-protocol-signature` header, you can be sure that the request was truly coming from Protocol. It's essential to keep your secret webhook key safe — otherwise, you can no longer be sure that a given webhook was sent by Protocol. Don't commit your secret webhook key to GitHub!
