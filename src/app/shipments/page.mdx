# Shipments

Shipments are the core records in Evership â€” they represent the packages being prepared for delivery, including the sender and recipient information, parcel dimensions, and selected shipping service. On this page, we'll explore the endpoints available for managing shipments programmatically. You can create, retrieve, update, purchase, cancel, and delete shipments through the API.
## The shipment model

The shipment model stores all the details needed to fulfill and track a shipment. Each shipment must have a collection and delivery address, at least one parcel, and can optionally include metadata like order number or customer contact information. Shipments can be created in a pending state or immediately purchased if a rate is available.

    The "Create shipment" API will allow you to create a single shipment record on your account in either a pending or purchased state with a single call.  If the shipment is not purchased when the record is created you can purchase the shipment later using the [Purchase shipments](https://www.notion.so/Purchase-shipments-1d0f4d58d4e381cdb0a1f361936864af?pvs=21) API
